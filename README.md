# Educational Tutor and Unvertainty evaluation of the LLM answers 
Welcome to the Educational Tutor and Uncertainty Evaluation repository!

Here, you'll explore the creation of an educational tutor, which takes the form of a chatbot. We leverage Langchain and RAG methodology, along with Chainlit to craft an intuitive user interface, facilitating seamless interaction.

Additionally, we employ the lm_polygraph library (link to corresponding repository: https://github.com/IINemo/lm-polygraph) to rigorously evaluate the uncertainty inherent in the answers provided. This entails leveraging black-box models to comprehensively assess and understand the confidence levels associated with responses.

Feel free to investigate, contribute, and innovate as we embark on our journey through the realm of educational technology and uncertainty evaluation!
