# Educational Tutor and Uncertainty evaluation of the LLM answers 
Welcome to the Educational Tutor and Uncertainty Evaluation repository!

This repository extends my Masterâ€™s Thesis on Fundamental Principles of Data Science at the Universitat de Barcelona. It contains all the necessary code for implementing the tasks outlined in the thesis, as well as the resulting datasets (CSV and Excel files).

Here, you'll explore the creation of an educational tutor, which takes the form of a chatbot. We leverage Langchain and RAG methodology, along with Chainlit to craft an intuitive user interface, facilitating seamless interaction.

Additionally, we employ the lm_polygraph library (link to corresponding repository: https://github.com/IINemo/lm-polygraph) to rigorously evaluate the uncertainty of the corresponding chatbot prompts/questions. This entails leveraging black-box models to comprehensively assess and understand the confidence levels associated with responses.

Feel free to investigate, contribute, and innovate as we embark on our journey through the realm of educational technology and uncertainty evaluation!
